hey

why? why not

install NSIS before trying to use this because otherwise the builder wont work

please ask the smart minds of your community for further help

you the smart kids, help the poor kids please

and make tutorials too

improve this so it gets even better, and publish your modifications too, stop that war of who is hiding the code better, we all know you code like shit, I did code like shit at some point too

hope it isnt too shit this time

all this is licensed under the GPLv3 (you may be sued for not publishing modifications to this, read the license, google it damn it)

the shellcode needs a JMP instruction added at the top, so it jumps to the entrypoint of it, E9 <32bit little endian>

please explain it for me to the lost ones

THIS IS ALL ABOUT SHARING LOVE, SO DON'T FORGET TO DO THE SAME YOURSELF TOO
